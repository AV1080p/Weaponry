# Weaponry

A collection of offensive code used for red team engagements. 

### ObfuscateMeterpeterReverseTcp.py
```
    * Basic shell code loader. (Credit: https://ired.team)

    * Uses subprocess to call MSFVenom, creating a reverse TCP payload with supplied LHOST and LPORT parameters, saving C payload to a temporary file.

    * Loads temporary file, replacing standard variable names with random values of varying lengths, altering static signature of the executable.

    * Outputs modified Meterpeter payload in C for compilation with Visual Studio Community

    TODO: Add in "junk" logic, more anti-debug.
